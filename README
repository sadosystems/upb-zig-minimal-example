# μpb-Zig Minimal Example   
This is a minimal example of the use of upb-zig in a Zig project.




from the sdl minimal example
Recommanded setup on Windows if you don't have Visual Studio (e.g. you only have Visual Studio Code)

Use the following instructions. It boils down to:
Installing MSYS2
Installing the MinGW-w64 toolchain using pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
Adding the path to gcc.exe to the system PATH variable. Likely you'd want to modify it from Environment variables editor in Windows Settings, so that it points to C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin
Download the libSDL2 development package for MinGW from here.
E.g., use SDL2-devel-2.30.1-mingw.zip
Install CMake — any version later than 3.7 is OK.
Make a "SDK" directory, either in a "develop" subfolder in your user directory (e.g. C:\Users\«USERNAME»\develop\SDK) or in C:\
Unarchive the SDL2-devel there, e.g. so that CMake can see C:\Users\«USERNAME»\develop\SDK\SDL2-2.30.1\cmake
To compile sdl-minimal manually:

Create a "build" directory: mkdir build
Change into it: cd build
Run CMake, targeting MinGW: cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
Run make to build your code
To run it:

Copy SDL2.dll from SDL2\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin\ to your "build" directory
You're all set - run sdl-minimal.exe
